SoundCloud Visualizer
=====================

Here's a new sort of visualizer for SoundCloud tracks. The idea behind this project is that an artist could be represented with his followers (represented by dots) around them, and with each beat of the artist's track, their followers would be bounced back.

I'm considering adding an option to put different tracks in here, as well as improvements for the beat detection system and other improvements. Feel free to branch!
